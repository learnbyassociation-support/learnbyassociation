        <h1>LearnByAssociation Support</h1>
        <p>Welcome to LearnByAssociation support! We're here to help you make the most of your learning journey.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <h3>How do I create a new dictionary?</h3>
        <p>Tap the "+" button on the main screen to create a new dictionary. Give it a name, choose an icon, and configure your fields.</p>

        <h3>Can I add images to my flashcards?</h3>
        <p>Yes! When creating or editing an item, tap on any image field to either take a photo or select one from your photo library.</p>

        <h3>How does the learning algorithm work?</h3>
        <p>LearnByAssociation uses a smart algorithm that shows you difficult items more frequently. Items you mark as "hard" will appear more often than items you know well.</p>

        <h3>Can I share my dictionaries?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Use the Export feature in dictionary settings to save your dictionary as a file, then share it with others who can import it into their app.</p>

        <h3>How do I remove ads?</h3>
        <p>Upgrade to LearnByAssociation Premium to remove all ads and unlock additional features. Tap on any ad to learn more about premium options.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <h3>The app crashes when I add an image</h3>
        <p>Make sure you've granted camera and photo library permissions in Settings > LearnByAssociation.</p>

        <h3>My dictionaries disappeared</h3>
        <p>Check if you're signed into the same iCloud account. If you recently restored your device, you may need to restore from a backup.</p>

        <h3>Import isn't working</h3>
        <p>Make sure the file you're importing is a valid .json file exported from LearnByAssociation. Files from other apps won't work.</p>

        <p>Your learning data is stored locally on your device. We don't have access to your dictionaries or learning progress. <a href="privacy.html">View our Privacy Policy</a></p>
